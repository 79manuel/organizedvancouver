            <p>As a mid-career professional - I know first hand the challenges of juggling a full life.
                There are endless invitations, opportunities, and we have routine and random responsibilities
                that can’t be neglected. Life can be filled with mundane tasks unless we preserve time for what means
                the most to us - whether it is family, friends, career, or passion projects. With so many things to
                juggle, it’s easy to feel out of control. I believe it is important to rest at the end of the day in a
                space that feels clear - and it is possible to make that happen no matter what is going on in your life!
            </p>
            <p>Let me tell you a little about my background. I have been organizing since as long as I can remember.
                Imagine a 7-year-old experimenting with different ways to organize Christmas presents! I probably
                discovered every imaginable way to organize these boxes! I was always trying new ways or arranging
                furniture and objects in my bedroom and in our home. Nothing has changed. I am still always looking for
                ways to find more order in my home office, my closet, and the rest of my house. I am always curious to
                see how other people arrange their space and their time.
            </p>
            <p>When I look at a space, I want things to look nice. It’s easier on the eyes and it puts the mind at ease.
                When I’m looking for a piece of clothing or a document, I want to find them easily - every time. When I
                run errands, I want to be efficient. Who wants to go back to the grocery store because they forgot to
                write coffee on the grocery list? My space and time need to be organized, easy and optimized!
            </p>
            <p>For the majority of my professional career, I have worked for a Fortune 500 organization as a successful
                sales professional. This type of energetic career path requires an impressive ability to manage
                information, schedules, set priorities and travel efficiently. Over the years, I have learned a few
                tricks of the trade. Now I find my colleagues look to me for advice on organizing.
            </p>
            <p>My journey to becoming a professional organizer really was cinched when I moved from an apartment into a
                house. My condominium was so well organized that when I moved into my bigger place, I found that my new
                space was immediately filled! I had accumulated more things than I used and it was time to purge!
                Moving truly reinforced what every good organizer knows - keep only what you use and love.
            </p>
            <p>I believe that order in our outer world brings clarity in our inner world. I am so excited to help others
                achieve this peace and clarity through space, time and information organization.
